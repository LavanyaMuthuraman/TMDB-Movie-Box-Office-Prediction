# TMDB-Movie-Box-Office-Prediction

### **Description:**

The purpose of the project is to **predict the overall worldwide box office revenue of the movies.**
This project aims to predict movie revenues for movies in The Movie Database (TMDb). Included are examples of feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing/cleaning, and evaluation of our models.

The dataset has been collected from TMDB Movie Database (TMDb) and it includes cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, and countries etc.,

Analysed the data by rigorous Exploratory Data Analysis and feature engineering to extract as much information as possible from the dataset. Made new features using the original features after careful EDA. Then creating models first trained a **Random Forest, Extra trees, XG Boost Model and LightGBM Model,** using the default hyperparameters and then later used GridSearchCV to find better set of hyperparameters.
